i'm using django-cors-headers because in browsers website cannot ask for things from another domain. but here i am using seperate frontend and backend that is why i need to use this to be able to access data from another domain.(Cross Origin Resource Sharing)

I'm trying to fetch all products intially when user goes to shop then i show them products based on their search,sort from client side
i'm not uploading images from backend but remember to do that nor will not be able to show sample products



Just copy paste the Products List code to HomeProducts except search option

solve the access and refresh token problem
